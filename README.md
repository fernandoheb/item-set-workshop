# Item Set Workshop

This is my entry to the Api Challenge of Riot Games. Not too documented yet because ideas are still flowing. The base 
concept is to create an application where users can build item sets from scratch or based on a build of a player on
their match history. Under which methods we reach that goal is still in brainstorming session. However,
AngularJS + ExpressJSis going to start rolling here ;)
