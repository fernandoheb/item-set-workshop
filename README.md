# Pick Your Brawler

This is my entry to the Api Challenge of Riot Games. Not too documented yet because ideas are still flowing. The base 
concept is to create an application where users can see how their peers chose the brawlers and how it affected their 
games. Under which methods we reach that goal is still in brainstorming session. However, AngularJS + ExpressJS is going
to start rolling here ;)
